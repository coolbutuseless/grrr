# `grrr`: Remove default arguments <img src="man/figures/grrr.png" width = "15%" align="right"/>



`R` has some default arguments that can make programming with R annoying - 
`stringsAsFactors = TRUE` immediately springs to mind.

This package can change default arguments
in pre-existing functions to be almost anything.


## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("coolbutuseless/grrr")
```


## Example 1: Change `mean` to use `na.rm = TRUE` by default

A call to `mean` will not remove `NA` values from the input i.e. `na.rm = FALSE`.

We can switch this default to `na.rm = TRUE` so that `NA` values are *always* 
removed:

```{r}
grrr::update_function_arguments('mean.default', 'base', na.rm=TRUE)

mean(c(1, 3, 5, NA))
```




## Example 2: Change `quantile` to not have a default value for  `na.rm`

A problem with changing the default value to be different, is that while the
code may work on your machine, it will still have the old behaviour for any
one else running the code.

A safer way to change the default value would be to remove it altogether!

This way, you are forced to explicitly set a good/sane default value every time
the function is called.

In the following call, the default value `na.rm` is removed, and thus an error
will occur anytime we use the function without explictly setting the value.

```{r error = TRUE}
grrr::update_function_arguments('quantile.default', 'stats', na.rm=)

quantile(1:10)
```







## Example 3: Print warnings when defaults are used

The problem with unsetting the default value is that there may be numerous places
in packages that make use this assumption you've just removed! So you'll end up with errors in places
you can't access to fix.

In this example, the `stringsAsFactors` argument to `data.frame()` is being changed
to print a message if an explicit value isn't given (but it will still go ahead
and use the default anyway).

This way, you'll be notified when it happens, but no error will occur.



```{r}
grrr::update_function_arguments(
  function_name    = 'data.frame', 
  package_name     = 'base', 
  stringsAsFactors = { message("Using default stringsAsFactors in data.frame()"); default.stringsAsFactors() } 
)
```


```{r}
data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c('a', 'b', 'c'))
```


# FAQ

## Why not just re-assign the function in the global namespace?

Because that won't fix places which call the function explicitly e.g. 
`stats::quantile()`

## Why not use `purrr::partial()`?

Because that won't change the function where it lives.



# Warning

This package uses `unlockBinding()` and `assignInNamespace()` and messes with
the internals of other packages which is generally frowned upon.

Furthermore,  `assignInNamespace()` actually has some checks
to prevent what I'm trying to do.  So there is now `grrr::sudo_assignInNamespace()`
which drops some sanity checks.  #madness
